# Game Dev Resources

Assembled, you will find tools that I have found useful in my (limited) game development experience.  The resources have been organized by where they are used.  Accounted for so far, please find resources for

* [Godot](./Godot/)
* [Pixel Art](./PixelArt/)

If you would like to contribute code, please submit a pull request and I'd be happy to merge it.  Please explain why any additions are useful.  My only request is that your code adhear to best practices in the engine/framework it's written for.  I will review submissions but likely default to including your work.

All work is liscensed under the MIT License.  If you would like to contribute, make sure you have rights to your code and are willing to liscense it the same way.

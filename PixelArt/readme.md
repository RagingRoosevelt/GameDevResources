## Bitmasks for Auto Tiling

Use these images in Aseprite as reference layers (Layer → New... → New Reference Layer from File).  These images can be used to remind yourself of all needed bitmask configurations when using an autotiler.

Available images are

* <img src="Bitmask_Reference_2x2.png" height="24px" style="image-rendering: pixelated;" alt="2x2 bitmask"> ([.asprite](Bitmask_Reference_2x2.aseprite))
* <img src="Bitmask_Reference_3x3.png" height="24px" style="image-rendering: pixelated;" alt="3x3 bitmask"> ([.asprite](Bitmask_Reference_3x3.aseprite))

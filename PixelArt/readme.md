## Bitmasks for Auto Tiling

Use these images in Aseprite as reference layers (Layer → New... → New Reference Layer from File).  These images can be used to remind yourself of all needed bitmask configurations when using an autotiler.

You can read more about Auto Tiling in Godot [here](https://michagamedev.wordpress.com/2018/02/24/181/), but it also describes the general principle that so that you can understand it if it's available in other games.

Available images are

* ![2x2 bitmask](Bitmask_Reference_2x2.png | width=250) ([.asprite](Bitmask_Reference_2x2.aseprite))
* ![3x3 bitmask](Bitmask_Reference_3x3.png | width=250) ([.asprite](Bitmask_Reference_3x3.aseprite))
